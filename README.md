# Welcome to HNQIS2 repository

PSI in partnership with the University of Oslo is developing a tool that enables the support health service quality improvement by providing face-to-face coaching between health providers and health supervisors .Building on lessons learned from use of the Health Network Quality Improvement System (HNQIS) custom Android app (in the public and private health sectors), PSI has built HNQIS 2.0. This new tool enables out-of-the-box DHIS2 to cost-effectively improve quality of healthcare. It does this by allowing Quality Assurance Officers (QAOs) to assess and improve providers’ knowledge and skills in health service provision, plan supportive supervision visits where and when they are most needed, and monitor quality trends over time. In addition, thanks to DHIS2 analytics capabilities, health system managers will be able to identify common and recurring gaps of health service provision and geographic priority areas of intervention—informing their decision-making processes (Sheets, 2021).

This repository contains the main technical and user guides for the correct configuration and use of the PSI's Android Fork App. Click [here](https://github.com/psi-org/hnqis2/wiki) to review them.
